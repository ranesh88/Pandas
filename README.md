# What is Python Pandas used for?

The Pandas library is generally used for data science, but have you wondered why? This is because the Pandas library is used in conjunction with other libraries that are used for data science.

It is built on top of the NumPy library which means that a lot of the structures of NumPy are used or replicated in Pandas.

The data produced by Pandas is often used as input for plotting functions in Matplotlib, statistical analysis in SciPy, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

You must be wondering, Why should you use the Pandas Library. Pythonâ€™s Pandas library is the best tool to analyze, clean, and manipulate data.

Here is a list of things that we can do using Pandas.

Data set cleaning, merging, and joining.
Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.
Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher-dimensional objects.
Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
Data Visualization.
